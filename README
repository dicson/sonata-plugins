musicbrainz.py
================================

what this is
---------------------

a sonata plugin that interprets files' metadata about musicbrainz, queries the
musicbrainz server and displays information acquired (currently, only hyperlinks).

by doing so, the plugin tries to explore the needs of plugins in sonata.

what this is not
---------------------

this plugin will be absolutely useless if the files are not musicbrainz tagged,
eg by musicbrainz picard. it will not try to guess which song this is in
musicbrainz, and does not support writing any tags. picard is more suited for
this job. (adding an option to launch picard on an unknown file is probably as
far as it will get on that issue.)

open issues
---------------------

no caching is done, resulting in hits on the mb servers on every track change
(this is even a security issue, enabling them to track what you hear, in
theory). will have to investigate if there is some cross-app way of doing so.

no asynchronous processing or threaded processing is done, resulting in user
interface lockup while the queries are processed.

the on_change_song hook is implemented very crudely, so exceptions thrown from
the plugin stop album art from working.
